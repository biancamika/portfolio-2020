      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>Quarantine has drastically upended people's sense of time. Because of this, they struggle to maintain healthy habits.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Brief</h3>
        <p>Lifelign is a habit tracker app centered on three core needs: food, exercise, and sleep. It is designed as both a schedule where people can time block their habits, and a journal where they can reflect on their progress.</p>
        <p>Overall, these features were made to help enhance mindfulness and well-being.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-md-4">
        <h3>Target</h3>
        <p>Lifelign was designed for Gen Z and Millenials who desire to have healthy habits, but struggle with the motivation and discipline needed to sustain them.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <h2>Research</h2>
        <h3>Interviews</h3>
        <p>Interviews were conducted with college freshmen and an early career architect. All were at varying levels of fitness. I asked them about how they keep fit through exercise and other activities, other ways they stayed healthy, and how their lifestyle was affected by quarantine. I gained the following insights:</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Routines are Crucial</h4>
        <p>Contrary to my assumptions, most of my interviewees were actually exercising more during quarantine. This was due to them making time for it in their schedules.</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">People are Influential</h4>
        <p>To get critique or support, the interviewees would show pictures of themselves to friends and family. They also helped keep the interviewees' fitness accountable (e.g. group workout calls).</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Habits are Interdependent</h4>
        <p>The way the participants ate and slept affected their energy during exercise, and vice versa.</p>
        <h3>Pain Points</h3>
        <p>The last insight made me realize that tackling other habits were needed as well. Thus, I decided to make my case study a tracker for healthy habits. I then determined the following:</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Time Management</h4>
        <p>The interviewees who were exercising more during quarantine said this was because they finally had the time they didn't have in the past. But could this habit become sustainable? What would happen when their daily commitments returned?</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Tracking is Tedious</h4>
        <p>Everyone wasn't big tracking. Most of them tried standard apps like MyFitnessPal, and eventually abandoned them; two of them also used considerably inefficient methods (i.e. writing on Notes, leaving tabs open) for saving workouts they liked.</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Lack of Mindfulness</h4>
        <p>Everyone also struggled with overeating at times; this was most likely affected by their lack of tracking.</p>
        <h3>Job Stories</h3>
        <h4 class="text-muted">When I commit to a healthy fitness/eating/sleep routine...</h4>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>I want to receive reminders so that I won’t forget it.</li>
            <li>I want to let others know about it so that they can keep me accountable.</li>
            <li>I want to have a schedule for it so that I have a structure to guide me.</li>
            <li>I want to track my progress so that I can see whether I’ve improved/regressed, and stay motivated.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Personas</h3>
        <p>I created 3 personas that each lacked a specific healthy habit.</p>

        <h3>Journey Map</h3>
        <p>These journey maps were based on the 4 stages of competence, which was used as a framework to illustrate how all the personas struggled to build a healthy habit, whether it be for food, exercise, or sleep.</p>

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>User Flow</h3>
        <p>As a beginner, I initially came up with an ambitious user flow for the app's onboarding. However, while working on the app, I realized that this was impossible to prototype in Figma. Because of this, I made the app's entire user flow more realistic for my capabilities.</p>

        <h2>Interface</h2>
        <h3>Design Rationale</h3>
        <p>I wanted the app's identity to be friendly yet earnest. As a result, its look was minimalist (e.g. mostly white, sans serif font); that way, important elements such as habits became the focus. These were highlighted by using our main color green (symbolizing growth), along with simple icons and illustrations.</p>

        <h2>Result</h2>
        <h3>Testing</h3>
        <p>Due to being pressed for time, I decided to make my usability testers 2 of my siblings, who were both Gen Z who struggled with healthy habits. They both tested the prototype on an iPhone 6 with Figma Mirror.</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Quantitative</h4>
        <p>A simple guerilla testing sheet was used, grading their responses from a scale of 1-3 (1: not able to perform the task at all; 2: able to perform the task but struggling with issues; 3: able to perform the task quickly).</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Qualitative</h4>
        <p>Once testing was done, I interviewed them with questions based on validity (e.g. "Would you use this app?") and user feedback (e.g. "What's the hardest part of this app?").</p>
        <h3>Insights</h3>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Usability & Accessibility</h4>
        <p>The biggest critique I got from both testers and judges was the difficulty of using the app. A color scheme with a lack of contrast and small texts being lightweight led to a lack of readability. People also found the app's user experience clumsy, with instances like navigation icons being hard to press, and carousels requiring tapping instead of swiping.</p>
        <h4 class="text-muted">Motivation</h4>
        <p>I missed out on designing notification reminders, which are a core part of the habit building process. If I got to work on this, I'd have the app send notifications during periods of inactivity (e.g. missing out on scheduled lunch). One of my testers recommended that the app should be like an optimistic coach. For this, I'd design the app to have a personality, which would be shown in both visuals (e.g. a mascot, like Duolingo and Woebot) and copy (second person POV).</p>
